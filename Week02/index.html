<h1> Kentucky Apparently </h1>

<p class="p1">
	Shoeless: Down the ailes of Walmart, you can look, and without fail there will be shoeless people all around.
	This is not for their lack of haveing shoes. Most of the people that live in Kentucky are farmers of some sort.
	They take off their shoes as a curtousy to Walmart so that they do no get manure and mud everywhere.
</p>

<p class="p2">
	Toothless: This is more fact that fiction whether many Kentuckians choose to believe so or not.
	This is becuase of the heavy smoking habits that are fostered in Kentucky. Kentucky grows tobacco as a cash crop.
	This makes the tobacco in sold in Kentucky much cheaper that the rest of the Country. This causes Kentuckians, in general,
	to smoke more frequently. The constant smoking causes the teeth to rot at a faster rate, which in turn causes people to 
	be toothless.
</p>

<p class="p3">
	No running water: This is not for the lack of having available clean water.
	In fact, Kentucky is abundant in fresh water streams and lakes. Most Kentuckians do not use the running water in their house
	in order to conserve the beautiful natural resources that Kentucky has to offer.
</p>

<p class="p1">
	Inbred: Kentucky is the only state in the United States of America that on the marriage license it states "How are you related?"
	rather than "Are you related?" There is also a well known community up in the Appalachian Mountians known to many as The Blue People. 
	This is becauase that community has lived isolated with each other for many years. A globulin deficiency, that would normally be a 
	dormant trait, became a dominant trait through many generations of inbreeding. This globulin deficiency has cuase these peoples' skin
	to appear with a blueish hue.
</p>

<p class="p2">
	Horses: One thing that Kentucky, especially Louisville, is well known for is The Kentucky Derby. This even happens once a year. 
	Some commentators have called it the fastest two minutes of sports. In this race a dozen of the best horses in the league race 
	around a mile track and see who wins. The winning horse is awarded with a garland of roses and for this reason it is sometimes called
	the run for the roses.
</p>

<p class="p3">
	Disclaimer: Some of these are fact but most are fiction. I have lived in Kentucky for many years and while all of these stereotypes
	hold true at one point in time or another, they do not tend to reflect the actions, qualities, or behaviors of the entire state.
